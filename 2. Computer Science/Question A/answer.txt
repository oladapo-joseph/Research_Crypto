Why is it a bad idea to use recursion for Fibonacci sequence?

The Fibonacci Sequence:

A Fibonacci sequence is an type of sequence that the nth term is function of the
summation the two previous terms in the sequence.
                X(n) =X(n-1) + X(n-2)

It is an infinite sequence.

Recursion:
A recursion is a function that execute repeatedly for a given, n, number of times.


Answer:
It is a totally bad idea because Fibonacci sequence is a sequence that tend to infinity, so
using a recursion to calculate an infinite sequence will create an infinite loop.

But, nevertheless we can use a recursion to find the nth term of a Fibonacci
sequence. That I feel is the only application of recursion to the Fibonacci sequence
